# Kameleoon Trial Task  

#### The API should allow:

* creation of a user account (deletion and other CRUD operations not requested). User properties are name, email, password and date of creation;
* addition, viewing (including a method to get a random quote), modification, and deletion of quotes (real deletion from the database, not just via an archive flag). Quote properties include content, date of creation / update, link to user who posted it, link to votes;
* voting on quotes (either upvote or downvote);
* view of the top and worse 10 quotes, the details of each quote, and ideally a graph of the evolution of the votes over time.
